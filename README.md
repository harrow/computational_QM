# Computational Quantum Mechanics

Adapted from course material for [Computational Methods in Many-Body Physics](https://github.com/jhauschild/lecture_comp_methods) by Prof. Frank Pollmann, Prof. Michael Knap and Johannes Hauschild.

## Setup
If you are completely new to python, you might start with the [scipy lectures](https://scipy-lectures.org/).

If you have a laptop, a very good python distribution is provided by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  Should give more instructions here.

Python is a flexible language but can come at the price of speed.  One way to speed up some python code is with the [numba package](http://numba.pydata.org/).
If you have trouble installing numba, or find the error messages produced by it too confusing,
you can copy the file `numba.py` providing a dummy `@jit` decorator into the other folders.
The price is that you lose the speed-up...
